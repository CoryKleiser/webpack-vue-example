# Import images via javascript and pass to child vue component as prop

> Demonstration of the above

## Build Setup

``` bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/CoryKleiser/webpack-vue-example.git

# enter project directory
cd webpack-vue-example

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

```

Open localhost:8080 and see vue logo image appearing. In App.vue look at how I pass that image to MyComponent.
